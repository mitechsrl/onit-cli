# Getting started

This tutorial will show how to create a new onit-based app.

Before starting, make sure you have these requirements:

- onit-cli installed (See how to install [here](MAIN-md))
- Mongodb >4.2.X installed & running

To create a new, onit-based app, open a terminal and type the command

```sh
> onit create app
```

This command will ask you some infos, like **application name**, a **short description** and some other values. After those questions, the tool will clone an empty example project from github onit repos.

When the command finish, type

```sh
> cd [myAppName]
> npm install
```

After this, you are ready to launch onit. Just type

```sh
> onit serve
```

That's it.
